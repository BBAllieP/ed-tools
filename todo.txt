[x] create widget for tracking overall progress on mission tracker - Circular (creds)
[x] create widget for tracking overall progress on mission tracker - Linear (kills)
[x] calculate efficiency metrics for mission tracker header
[?] put mission tracker header in collapseable to save space
[x] ensmallen or get rid of the title bar on the pages (include instead in app bar on navigation)
[_] Backend: perform sanity check on mission redirect to update counts on unfinished missions for other factions
     This could actually cause a lot of problems if a mission is abandone
[x] Figure out how to spawn backend on load
[x] figure out build pipeline:
     - build go to executable first
     - execute backend on electron load
[x] test on live
[BOO] get alpha testers and ensure it works in other people's computers
     Thanks alpha testers! Looks like we have some bugs to work out and some new functionality to add:
[] Refactor backend->frontend to only send updates when updated, not have frontend consistently polling for the whole data stack
[] fix bug that double counts bounties
[] add snackbars when message received from backend (notistack)
[] Make layout for smaller screens
[] Make both current reward total and stack reward total visible in the circle progress
[] fix backend crash bugs (new)
[] Implement autoupdate in electron

*** MVP Ready
[] add cute lil "under construction" pages for the tabs not yet working
[] cleanup code base (lol never)
[] maybe add alerts for when you start taking hull damage
[] (far future) update a web API for potential mobile app later on


NEXT PROJECTS:
[] Import fleet from journal or allow from Inara
    - use this to make export/copy functionality for importing to other tools
[] Build route planner helper:
     - takes as input CSV export from spansh that can be dragged and dropped on window
     - auto determine if FC route, R2R or neutron plotter
     - copy to clipboard next step in route
     - determine when a jump has happened and copy next destination
     - see if it's possible to see when a body has been scanned
     - auto-tally R2R gains
[] Shield Calculator
     - Implement go shield calculator in backend
     - Customizable UI for shield calculator parameters
[] Engineering mats?
     - Could be possible to recreate EDEngineer basically but woof that's a lot of work
     - would love to add:
        - better search functionality, 
        - recommend number of rolls, 
        - suggest where to find what you need
