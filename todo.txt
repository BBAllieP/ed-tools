[x] create widget for tracking overall progress on mission tracker - Circular (creds)
[x] create widget for tracking overall progress on mission tracker - Linear (kills)
[x] calculate efficiency metrics for mission tracker header
[?] put mission tracker header in collapseable to save space
[x] ensmallen or get rid of the title bar on the pages (include instead in app bar on navigation)
[_] Backend: perform sanity check on mission redirect to update counts on unfinished missions for other factions
     This could actually cause a lot of problems if a mission is abandone
[x] Figure out how to spawn backend on 
[x] figure out build pipeline:
     - build go to executable first
     - execute backend on electron load
[x] test on live
[] get alpha testers and ensure it works in other people's computers
*** MVP Ready

NEXT PROJECTS:
[] Import fleet from journal or allow from Inara
    - use this to make export/copy functionality for importing to other tools
[] Build route planner helper:
     - takes as input CSV export from spansh that can be dragged and dropped on window
     - auto determine if FC route, R2R or neutron plotter
     - copy to clipboard next step in route
     - determine when a jump has happened and copy next destination
     - see if it's possible to see when a body has been scanned
     - auto-tally R2R gains
[] Shield Calculator
     - Implement go shield calculator in backend
     - Customizable UI for shield calculator parameters
[] Engineering mats?
     - Could be possible to recreate EDEngineer basically but woof that's a lot of work
     - would love to add:
        - better search functionality, 
        - recommend number of rolls, 
        - suggest where to find what you need
